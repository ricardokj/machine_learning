About this Course

This Machine Learning with Python course dives into the basics of Machine Learning using Python, an approachable and well-known programming language. You'll learn about Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning, look into how Statistical Modeling relates to Machine Learning, and do a comparison of each.
Look at real-life examples of Machine Learning and how it affects society in ways you may not have guessed!

Explore many algorithms and models:

    Popular algorithms: Classification, Regression, Clustering, and Dimensional Reduction.
    Popular models: Train/Test Split, Root Mean Squared Error, and Random Forests.

More important, you will transform your theoretical knowledge in to practical skill using many hands-on labs.

Get ready to do more learning than your machine!
